# Goose
Goose is a scripting application designed to allow clinicians and researchers easy automation of common clinical GUI interfaces, such as Epic, Sectra, and others.

**Why is it named "Goose?"**<br>
Something along the lines of "GUI" but also how much of chart review and menial clicking tasks in these labyrinthine interfaces feels like a "wild goose chase."
